# NER_bc5cdr

Dataset : BC5CDR (BioCreative V CDR corpus)

Using trainer:  
In code NER_92.40, I reach f1_score = 92.40 in the testing set.  
In code NER_92.02, I reach f1_score = 92.02 in the testing set.   
In code NER_91.18, I reach f1_score = 91.18 in the testing set.  
In code NER_90.78, I reach f1_score = 90.78 in the testing set.  
In code NER_88.96, I reach f1_score = 88.96 in the testing set.
